## Ecommerce Website

If you are going to sell products online, a static blog website is no longer good for you. This time, you need a ecommerce website with JavaScript to manage functions like check out, and something like SQLite to manage your database. Django offers you a Python-based web framework to build your website.

I built two ecommerce websites for local businesses. The websites have functions including cart, order, coupon, users profile, inventory, newsletter, search, sitemaps, check out with Srtipe/ Paypal, invoices & receipts, related producs, and so on.

In the future, I will consider adding more animation with design in the Django website I built. Better customized UI is a great way for local business to stand out in the ecommerce trend nowadays.
